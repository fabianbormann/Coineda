## :exclamation: Disclaimer

Coineda does not provide tax, legal or accounting advices. The provided dashboard and rudimentary tax calculations may contain errors, are incorrect for your country or doesn't cover all tax relevant regulations. Those calculations are developed to the best of my knowledge but I'm not a tax export and I do not take any responsibility for incorrect calculations.

## Features

Tracking of crypo currencies should be free and open source. As a crypto trader I also take a lot of care about my privacy, so my tracking tool should run locally and not store my private data on "random" servers. All this requirements made me start writing an own coin tracking and tax overview tool which I want to share with all of you.

## How to contribute

Fork Coineda and implement a feature within a "feature/<feature_name>" branch or use "bug/<bug_name_or_issue_reference>" for bug fixes. Open a pull request  once you've finished. It would be really helpful if you open an issue with a short description for the feature or a bug before you start your implementation.
