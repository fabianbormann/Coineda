# Coineda
Coineda aims to be a free to use, open source and local running crypto track and tax tool

## Features

Tracking of crypo currencies should be free and open source. As a crypto trader I also take a lot of care about my privacy, so my tracking tool should run locally and not store my private data on "random" servers. All this requirements made me start writing an own coin tracking and tax overview tool which I want to share with all of you.

## Why AGPL-3.0

This software should be free to use and therefore forks, improvements or programs using Coineda should also be free to use for everyone. Even "as a service" solutions using Coineda functions should be open source and free to use. That's the reason why I used the AGPL-3.0 License for Coineda.
