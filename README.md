## :exclamation: Disclaimer

Coineda does not provide tax, legal or accounting advices. The provided dashboard and rudimentary tax calculations may contain errors, are incorrect for your country or doesn't cover all tax relevant regulations. Those calculations are developed to the best of my knowledge but I'm not a tax export and I do not take any responsibility for incorrect calculations.

## Features

Tracking of crypo currencies should be free and open source. As a crypto trader I also take a lot of care about my privacy, so my tracking tool should run locally and not store my private data on "random" servers. All this requirements made me start writing an own coin tracking and tax overview tool which I want to share with all of you.

## Why AGPL-3.0

This software should be free to use and therefore forks, improvements or programs using Coineda should also be free to use for everyone. Even "as a service" solutions using Coineda functions should be open source and free to use. That's the reason why I used the AGPL-3.0 License for Coineda.
